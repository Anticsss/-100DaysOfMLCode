# 100_Days_Of_ML_Code
## Day 0: December 04, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Setup the system.

1. Enrolled in [Machine Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/info) by Stanford University taught by Andrew NG on coursera.

2. Start following [Learn_Machine_Learning_in_3_Months](https://github.com/llSourcell/Learn_Machine_Learning_in_3_Months) by @llSourcell

**Thoughts:** Hope this will help me to do Machine Learning in more effective way and help me to win kaggle competition.


## Day 1: December 06, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Completed week1 of [Machine Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/info) by Stanford University taught by Andrew NG on coursera.

1. Learnt about what is Machine Learning
2. What is Supervised and Unsupervised Learning
3. Cost function, Gradient Descent
4. Univariate Linear Regression(ULR) and Multivariate Linear Regression(MLR)
5. Reviewed some concepts of Linear Algebra.

**Thoughts:** Understanding how model is represented and how to minimize cost(theta value) function and converge to best fit using gradient descent and normal equation mathematically as well as by coding is actually fun.
