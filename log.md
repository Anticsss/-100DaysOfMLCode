# 100_Days_Of_ML_Code
## Day 0: December 04, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Setup the system and enrolled in [Machine Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/info) by Stanford University taught by Andrew NG on coursera and will start following [Learn_Machine_Learning_in_3_Months](https://github.com/llSourcell/Learn_Machine_Learning_in_3_Months) by @llSourcell

**Thoughts:** Hope this will help me to do Machine Learning in more effective way and help me to win kaggle competition.
